# Chess

Part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails). This assignment uses Sinatra, Ruby, Javascript, JQuery, and HTML to build a web application: a chess game where you play against the computer. See the live version [here](https://arcane-oasis-62646.herokuapp.com/new).
